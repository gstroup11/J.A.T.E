## Description

J.A.T.E is exactly what it says!  It's just another text editor.  It is meant for JavaScript Syntax.  The main goal of this application was to experiment with PWA's and to learn more about JavaScript.  I also wanted to create a text editor that was simple and easy to use.  I hope you enjoy it!
